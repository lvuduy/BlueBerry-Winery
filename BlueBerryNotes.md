# Missing Info:
        Aging
        Pricing
        Brands
        Grape types
        Phenolics compound - Tannin (taste = bitter and dry sensation, makes wine more complex, last longer, bitter taste)

# Interesting facts
- White wine is the most common in the Vinho Verde region 
- The two most successful **white** wine varieties are **Alvarinho** and **Loureiro**. 
    - Alvarinho tends to produce low yields and can reach much higher alcohol levels --> grapefruit and floral notes
    - The most successful **red** wine grape has been **Vinhão** followed by Amaral/Azal-  with deep purple coloring and peppery notes

# The properties
- Residual Sugar:
    - the higher the residual sugar, the sweeter the wine tastes. 
    - On the other end of the spectrum, a wine that does not taste sweet is considered as dry
    - Very dry wines have virtually no sugar at all
    - Dry wines with hint of sweet make them full-bodied
    - Dry red wines such as cabernet sauvignon often have up to 0.9 g/L of residual sugar (common with cheap wines).


- Acidity:
    - Two types
        - Fixed (three primary acids 
            - a) citric 
            - b) malic 
            - c) tartaric

        - Volatie. 
        
        - Lack of fixed acidity = flat or one-dimensional wine = naturally in the grapes
        - volatile = arises in wine through fermentation (either through yeast or bacteria)
    
    - Citric acid is added to boost acidity
    - The main acid in wine is called tartaric acid. Doesn't decrease much during ripening
    - Malic acid decreases during ripending
    - Acidity in wine refers to the fresh and sour qualities of wine
    
    - White wines have more acidity than red wines
    - Red ones acidity range from low to high
    - Colder regions have more acidity and warmer regions have lesser
    - Acids are crucial in boosting the effect of sulfur dioxide, which essentially protects wines from spoilage and becoming rotten
    - Wines with higher acidity feel lighter-bodied because they come across as “spritzy.
    - less acidity = more rich and round
    - > Sweet Taste (sugars + alcohols) <= => Acid Taste (acids) + Bitter Taste (phenols)


- Sulphur:
    - Sulphur is used to preserve the wine from oxidation
    - Two types
        - Free sulphur and fixed sulphur
        - Free sulphur binds to micro-organisms
        - High fixed Sulphur could mean oxidation has happened - not good

- Alcohol:
    - Sweet wines tend to have lower Alcohol - 7 -7,5% --> fermentations could have been stopped early, 
    - Red wines have higher alchohol levels - more sugar and take longer to ripen
    - Sugar converts to Alcohol through yeast (funghi)
    - picking grapes when they are ripe results in sweeter wines or more alcohol if fermented out

    

- pH
    - low pH solutions = lower unwanted bacteria

- Other interesting facts
    - higher natural sugars and therefore higher alcohol
    - lower natural sugar and therefore higher natural acidity


- Correlations - assumptions to check
    - Lack of fixed acidity = flat or one-dimensional wine = naturally in grapes
    - Is more acidity better?
    - White wines have more acidity than red wines
    - High fixed Sulphur could mean oxidation has happened - not good
    - - > Sweet Taste (sugars + alcohols) <= => Acid Taste (acids) + Bitter Taste (phenols)
